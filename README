this directory contains a tiny brainfuck interpreter source (main.cc) and brainfuck code (from Wikipedia).

to compile:
   make brainfuck
 or
   make all

to execute:
  ./brainfuck helloworld.bf

to clean:
  make clean


this brainfuck interpreter recieves brainfuck source code as first argument.
stdin and stdout redirected to brainfuck's input and output respectively.


further work ideas:
* jump optimization
  current implementation searches matching ] and [ every time.
  it can be optimized memoise these position on first search,
  and then next time search could be replaced with fseek.
* functionize [ and ] processing
  for readablity, [ and ] processing code should be extracted
  as a function.
